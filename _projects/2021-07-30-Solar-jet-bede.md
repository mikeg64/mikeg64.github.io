# A Study of Solar Jets Using 2D MHD





## Background

The sun displays a number of magnetic flux tube phenomena including spicules, macrospicules, jets, dynamic fibrils such features propagate through the solar atmosphere and influence the balance of energy between the solar corona and the plasma pressure dominated atmosphere i.e. the photosphere and the chromosphere

In earlier studies extended drivers were employed to simulate wave dynamics generated by solar global oscillating eigen modes. Prior to this 2D studies using point drivers revealed a range of oscillatory and atmospheric structural phenomena. For this study we want to undertake long time range simulations in both non-magnetised and magentised solar atmospheres at high resolutions so as to understand possible structurs induced in the transition region i.e. we want to understand phenomena influencing the heating of chromospheric plasma.

In particular we investigate drivers which simulate jet phonemena in the solar atmosphere.
