# p-Mode Oscillations in Highly Gravitationally Stratified Magnetic Solar Atmospheres





## Background

Observational, theoretical and computational studies of the sun reveal a diversity of  structures and complex dynamics. This is clearly revealed by imagery from solar telescopes. The culmination of studies of the dynamics of the coronal loop structures  in the solar atmosphere and in the solar chromosphere has developed our understanding of the range of different magnetic field structures. The images from SDO in nine AIA passbands (\ref{sdoaia}) display some of these structures such as active regions, coronal holes and quiet regions. Despite our armoury of observations and diverse range of computational models it still remains a challenge to make sense of this complex menagerie of dynamical structures, understand solar coronal heating and more generally space weather phenomena. Development of our understanding requires computational models enabling us to study the relationship between structures in the solar atmosphere and the continual dynamical processes.

We report on the results of numerical simulations of photospheric p-mode oscillations in a model solar atmosphere with a uniform and vertical magnetic field. First, we consider the variety of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere and review the wave motions which are observed in these regions. This is followed with a description of the solar atmospheric model, magnetic field configuration and the simulation method we used to model p-mode oscillations in a model magnetic solar atmosphere.

Dave Jess  discovered in some observations a very interesting feature: solar washing machine :) 


We have a magnetic flux tube model (up to 1 Mm) which we used for [SMAUG][1]
[1]: http://solarwavetheory.blogspot.com/2015/12/smaug-is-sheffield-magnetohydrodynamics.html paper. 


Can you, pls, run a simulation with exactly the same solar atmosphere model but with a different driver?

Driver should be just a  superposition
of two slow kink waves with the same phase speed, but different polarisation  ( one 0 and second one shifted by pi/2) 
and a constant phase difference in time.

Practically this is one  + another horizontal driver (which we have used before).

## some details below 

The sunspot movie has been filtered  *both* spatially and temporally using the following parameters:

frequency = 2-4 minutes with the Gaussian peaking at 3 minutes
spatial size = 5-10 arcsecond size (to break the sunspot umbra up into ~4 quadrants)





The resulting movie (just a 10 minute cut-out from the time sequence) can be viewed here:

The green contour marks the umbra/penumbra boundary, and hopefully itâs obvious that strong-power oscillations are not only present in the umbra, but they also appear to rotate torsionally. This motion is much more apparent than in the previous spatially-unfiltered movies.
