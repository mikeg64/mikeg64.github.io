# p-Mode Oscillations in Highly Gravitationally Stratified Magnetic Solar Atmospheres





## Background

Observational, theoretical and computational studies of the sun reveal a diversity of  structures and complex dynamics. This is clearly revealed by imagery from solar telescopes. The culmination of studies of the dynamics of the coronal loop structures  in the solar atmosphere and in the solar chromosphere has developed our understanding of the range of different magnetic field structures. The images from SDO in nine AIA passbands (\ref{sdoaia}) display some of these structures such as active regions, coronal holes and quiet regions. Despite our armoury of observations and diverse range of computational models it still remains a challenge to make sense of this complex menagerie of dynamical structures, understand solar coronal heating and more generally space weather phenomena. Development of our understanding requires computational models enabling us to study the relationship between structures in the solar atmosphere and the continual dynamical processes.

We report on the results of numerical simulations of photospheric p-mode oscillations in a model solar atmosphere with a uniform and vertical magnetic field. First, we consider the variety of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere and review the wave motions which are observed in these regions. This is followed with a description of the solar atmospheric model, magnetic field configuration and the simulation method we used to model p-mode oscillations in a model magnetic solar atmosphere.
