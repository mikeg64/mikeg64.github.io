# Background

Dave Jess  discovered in some observations a very interesting feature: solar washing machine :) 


We have a magnetic flux tube model (up to 1 Mm) which we used for [SMAUG](http://solarwavetheory.blogspot.com/2015/12/smaug-is-sheffield-magnetohydrodynamics.html) paper. 


Can you, pls, run a simulation with exactly the same solar atmosphere model but with a different driver?

Driver should be just a  superposition
of two slow kink waves with the same phase speed, but different polarisation  ( one 0 and second one shifted by pi/2) 
and a constant phase difference in time.

Practically this is one  + another horizontal driver (which we have used before).

## some details below 

The sunspot movie has been filtered  *both* spatially and temporally using the following parameters:

frequency = 2-4 minutes with the Gaussian peaking at 3 minutes
spatial size = 5-10 arcsecond size (to break the sunspot umbra up into ~4 quadrants)





The resulting movie (just a 10 minute cut-out from the time sequence) can be viewed here:

The green contour marks the umbra/penumbra boundary, and hopefully itâ€™s obvious that strong-power oscillations are not only present in the umbra, but they also appear to rotate torsionally. This motion is much more apparent than in the previous spatially-unfiltered movies.
