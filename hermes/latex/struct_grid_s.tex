\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
3D arrays of dependent variables, plus grid data, plus particle data, plus data about child and parent Grids, plus M\+PI rank information for a Grid. 

Remember a Grid is defined as the region of a Domain at some refinement level being updated by a single processor. Uses an array of \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_cons_s}{ConsS}}, rather than arrays of each variable, to increase locality of data for a given cell in memory. ~\newline
