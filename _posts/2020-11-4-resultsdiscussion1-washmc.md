We want to measure the phase difference between oscillations of Bz. and vz i.e. the vertical component of the B field and the plasma velocity respectively.
With the recent series of models this was challenging  for the following reasons:

* One of the drivers had multiple frequencies
* Driver had a damping factor
* The first model run uni1 did not have a damping factor but the amplitude was too low

The model amplitude was set to aa=10.0

The revised input files for this run are linked on git below

git commit id[da9600eab0e4b4c9766c72a376d9b6d996b60ea6](https://github.com/mikeg64/smaug_wash/commit/da9600eab0e4b4c9766c72a376d9b6d996b60ea6)

When converting the output files to an ascii format for input we used an IDL script.

 
[make_ini_file_3D_bintoascii.pro](https://github.com/mikeg64/smaug_wash/blob/master/Idl/make_ini_file_3D_bintoascii.pro).
After editing the file names in the idl script this is run from the idl prompt using:

.r make_ini_file_3D_bintoascii

TODO: write script in matlab/python to do the conversion [matlab/python - code convert iput file formats](https://trello.com/c/GVPcXs0A/21-matlab-python-code-convert-iput-file-formats)
