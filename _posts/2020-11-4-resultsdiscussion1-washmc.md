We want to measure the phase difference between oscillations of Bz. and vz i.e. the vertical component of the B field and the plasma velocity respectively.
With the recent series of models this was challenging  for the following reasons:

* One of the drivers had multiple frequencies
* Driver had a damping factor
* The first model run uni1 did not have a damping factor but the amplitude was too low


In all cases the  [distance time plots](http://mikeg64.github.io/washing/machine/update/2020/10/14/dtplots1-washmc.html) demonstrate that the cycles start after a quarter of a period i.e after 45s.

The [movies](http://mikeg64.github.io/washing/machine/update/2020/10/13/moviesunitube1-washmc.html) illustrate that the combination of two mutually perpendicular linear kink drivers wich are out of phase by a quarter of a cycle results in the appearance of a circular oscillation.

For case 1 (uni1) - we observe an undamped periodic cycle with the same frequency  as the driver - after an initial increase the maximum amplitude of the vertical velocity component has a fixed maximum amplitude

For case 2 and 3 (uni2 and uni3) - the amplitude of oscillations rises to a maximum and then decays away, a period consistent with that of the driver is superimposed on the signal.

For case 4 (uni 4) - the amplitude of oscillations rises to a maximum and then decays away, a period consistent with that of the driver is superimposed on the signal.Since the driver is a superposition of three frequencies we can see evidence of these in the signal.
