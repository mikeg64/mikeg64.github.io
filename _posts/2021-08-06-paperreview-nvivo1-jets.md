# Using NVIVO to Review Papers for the Jet Study

## Background

Recording the research process has moved away from the tradtional lab notebook and much more use is mdae of blogging style approaches. There is a collection of online resources used for documenting the research process for examples see the references [1], [2], [12] and [3] below.

However, recording the provenance of different datasets, used, generated and accessed throughout the project can be challenging particularly ensuring that we are working with the correct data set versions.

We want to use the NVIVO software to
1. Manage the literature review
2. Manage and track the data sets
